The first interactive option is a checkbox that includes listing over 30 days old. By default these are not included in any of the graphics.
Adjust the interactive plots/graphs to see the information relevant to you. There are select boxes for each graph that allow you to see different values specified for each graphic. On the side of each plot, after you use the selectbox option, you can designated which of the categories you wish to see displayed.
There are also sliders for each graphic that let you adjust each one's x-axis values, which allows you to narrow or broaden your view and the data displayed.
For the is_4wd category in the selectboxes - this specifies whether a vehicle was listed for sale with 4 wheel drive (1), or was not listed to have 4 wheel drive (0).

Note on edits:

I used the suggested code, with modification to make it functional to replace the model year, weighing in model and condition. And replaced the odometer with similar code weighing in type (to give a more generalized picture of usage/miles driven) and condition.
